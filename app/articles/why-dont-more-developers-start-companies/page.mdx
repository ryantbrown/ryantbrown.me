Most developers work on software products. Whether directly building user-facing applications, creating internal tools, or managing infrastructure, almost everything we do is related to supporting one or more product lines. 

How detailed a given product strategy is, and how close developers are to that strategy, is a function of team size, company culture, and their position. The best developers, regardless of position, care deeply about product development, product strategy and user needs.

Given this close proximity to Product, a surprisingly small number of developers start their own software companies. Why is this the case? It’s easy to assume the reasons we’ve all heard: fear of failure, risk aversion, lack of time, financial instability, and a [host of others](https://zapier.com/blog/potential-entrepreneurs-report/).

While these reasons may play a role, they don’t tell the full story. There are only two fundamental reasons people don’t do something: they either don’t want to, or they don’t know how. Let’s explore both of these in the context of today’s world.

## Don’t Want To

On the surface, it might seem simple: maybe most developers just don’t want to start their own company. They are content in their current role, enjoy a great work-life balance, and don’t have any desire to commit the significant resources needed in entrepreneurship.

However, this argument doesn’t match the data. Surveys indicate that [80% of developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pSf9_MgsZ4&pp=ygUac3RhY2sgb3ZlcmZsb3cgc3VydmV5IDIwMjQ%3D) are [not satisfied in their current role](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/professional-developers#job-industry-and-satisfaction-job-sat), and that [almost everybody wants to be their own boss](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230425005991/en/2023-Incfile-Small-Business-Trends-Survey-Reveals-90-of-Americans-Want-to-Be-Their-Own-Boss).

That leads us to what we discussed earlier. Developers don’t want to start a company because they are risk-averse, afraid to fail, and can’t stomach financial instability. While these reasons may be true for some, they are more “don’t know how” than “don’t want to.” After all, [fear is just ignorance in disguise](https://www.azquotes.com/quotes/topics/ignorance-and-fear.html), which brings us to the second, more complex reason.

## Don’t Know How

The argument that developers don’t start companies because they don’t know how is much more nuanced. Given the overwhelming perception of starting a company, the challenges seem endless.

You can’t think of an idea. You have an idea but you’re convinced it’s not big enough. You can’t make the finances work. The finances work but you don’t have enough time.

You have the time but you’re a frontend engineer who’s never deployed an application; an API engineer who’s never touched a user interface. Maybe you’re a brilliant full-stack engineer with a great design sense but you don’t know anything about sales and marketing. Maybe you can build the product in a weekend but won’t know what to do on Monday.

As endless as the reasons are, they are all different forms of “don’t know how”. The leap from working on a product as part of a team to starting, building, launching, growing and sustaining your own company involves a tremendous amount of work that is simply too overwhelming for one person, or even a small team, to take on. Or is it?

## Complexity Fallacy

The perceived complexity of building a software business is often overestimated. Starting a company is simply not as hard as it used to be. This is truer today than yesterday and it will be even truer tomorrow.

There will always be challenges and learning curves, but most are easily managed with the right mix of process and technology. In fact, modern technologies, especially A.I., have largely eroded the normal barriers to entry. Nearly all aspects of running a business, from incorporation to customer support, can effectively be streamlined, or entirely automated, with modern tools and services.

## Idea Detour

When I talk to developers, one thing that tends to stop them in their tracks is the idea. For some reason, they believe their idea must be a groundbreaking, never-before-seen innovation that will revolutionize an entire industry, maybe even the world. Or, they think all the good ideas are gone, never to return, while others are convinced their idea is so good it can’t be discussed without an NDA in place.

The reality is much more straightforward: ideas are cheap and widely available; execution is everything. Pick something you think you can do in a market that already exists, launch quickly and gather feedback. Real-world data is far more valuable than waiting for inspiration to strike.

## The Non-Negotiable

Ironically, the one thing you must do in order to start a business is the one thing you never hear people use as an excuse — hard work. People are willing to work hard and developers certainly do, they spend years perfecting their craft, consistently solve hard problems and are always learning new things.

## Conclusion

The modern developer has, at their fingertips, everything needed to build a successful software company. By acquiring an insanely valuable skillset, one that can be leveraged in nearly all aspects of running a company, they have already done the hard part. 

The future of entrepreneurship is about merging the right skills with the right tools to let technology do the work for you, developers are better positioned than almost anybody else to do just that.
